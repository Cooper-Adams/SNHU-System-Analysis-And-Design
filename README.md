# SNHU-System-Analysis-And-Design


    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    
    DriverPass was a company who was looking to fill a niche. They were looking to provide a hub for learning how to drive, and this was to be accomplished with an online system that would allow the user to take tests and schedule in-person driving sessions.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    
    I feel as though my writeups were done well. Whether it was in a project or a smaller assignment, I tried to be thorough and constantly reference the interview transcript to keep DriverPass' needs in mind when analyzing the current system's design.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
    If I were to revise anything, it would be the requirements in both projects. I was content with what I originally wrote, but with functional and non-functional requirements, there is always a lingering thought in my head of "but what if you missed something?" I'm sure I did miss out on a couple, so coming back to them weeks later with a fresh mindset may would allow me to list more.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    First, I took note of what the client wanted in the interview, and then made a schedule to keep the project on track. In that timeframe, I constantly referenced the information gathered from the interview and implemented it into the planning phases of the system design so that DriverPass' needs would be met when the system was functional. Considering the user's needs is of the utmost importance. Without a user or client, there is no purpose to the system to begin with, so addressing their needs ensures that the user's experience will be positive, as well as ensuring the system will serve its purpose.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    
    I try to be as thorough in the planning phases as possible. This means detailed documentation, constant communication between the team and client, and precise diagrams to reflect the system's behavior. With all of this in mind, putting the system/software together should be fairly easy, as the leg-work has already been done. In the future, I would like to practice with development methodologies like Agile or Waterfall to see how different forms of processing and revising can affect the flow and timeframe of a project.
